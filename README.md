# ABOUT ME
## Interests and Hobbies
* My interests within computer sciences include coding, analysis, data visualization, web programming, and security/threat protection. Outside of computer science, I enjoy learning about animals (especially felines, avians, and insects), plants and gardening, horror content, and basketball. In my free time, I like to paint, tend to my garden, birdwatch, and play horror games.
## Websites I Enjoy
* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - As someone who loves data analysis and is pursuing my Business Analytics degree, I'm always looking for new content packages to practice my formatting and analysis skills on, and Kaggle is an excellent source for .csv files in particular.
* [SAS OnDemand](https://welcome.oda.sas.com/) - Again, I love to use this website as a way to develop my coding and programming skills- something that's certainly needed in the data analytics field.
