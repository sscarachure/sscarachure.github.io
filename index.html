      <h1>My name is Seth Carachure</h1>
      <p>I'm working towards my degree in Business Analytics at Wake Tech, and I plan to transfer to NC State afterwards. I'm a huge fan of solving problems and puzzles, so all of the classes I'm taking are very enjoyable for me (analytical programming, analytics, web programming, and stats). In my free time, I like to tend to my garden, paint, play puzzle games, and spend time with my cat.</p>
